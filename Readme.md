# Welcome to Sis Gama BR

Sis Gama BR is an audacious project dedicated to the establishment of an innovative community of the most diverse and extremely decentralized.

Sis Gama BR's goal is to provide a unique source of essential Ethereum information. We have tried to achieve this through two main areas:

- Documents - open source, easy to understand documentation
- Newsletter - Sis Gama BR at Medium

The Documents section, where you are now, is the core of Sis Gama BR. This documentation is open source and hosted on GitHub, meaning anyone can contribute. The goal is to ensure that information is available, clear, concise and up to date.

Contribution Guidelines
In the interest of keeping Sis Gama BR content uniform, we have created a template that you can use when adding your own pages to the github repository.
